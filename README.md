**Project Profile**

This project “*Guardian Angel*” is aimed to seek help from the near and dear ones under the situation of threat to one’s life. Mainly made for women travelling during late night or passing by some crucial areas where one cannot get help easily.

This application will be very helpful as it is so handy that even an illiterate person can use it and seek for help when she’s in danger. She just need to press power button 3 times and automatically her current location link will be sent through SMS to previously fitted mobile numbers and also call to the top most mobile number will be made automatically. Hence, her near and dear ones can track the location and reach out to her to help.

**Project Definition**

When one passes by some areas alone and find herself under the threat of social mob then she can alert her near ones that she is under the threat and they can help her out but sometimes it is not possible to call them or tell the location and all and may be if she is in emergency situation then it’s the worst solution to call manually. So this help is made in such a way that user needs to do some predefined gesture and call will be made automatically with SMS containing link of her actual current location.

**PURPOSE**

As the crimes are increasing day by day, to prevent it and protect one for being a victim of crime by seeking help and alerting her dear ones that she’s at this particular location and needs your help is the main purpose for developing Guardian Angel. By this application, one can safely roam at midnight as she knows that Guardian Angel is always with her to protect.


**SCOPE** 

At this stage, Guardian Angel provides facility to call and alert only contacts but in future facilities like calling police and sending them location of individuals can also be done as an extension of current version.

For example, right now the person who received the SMS containing location link, tracks it and reaches to the spot but in future, SMS to the police can also be made and can seek the help quickly.

**Literature Review**

The newspapers and articles contain the heading of brutal rape cases or murder cases on each other day. One of them was blowing mind of everyone that a girl became victim of rape and though the spot area was near her house she could not found help though had having phone.

Many a times it’s been seen that the woman passing by some desolate area and became the quarry of one’s bad will as she could not seek help. It is not only about woman it is about children too. Like It has also been seen that children became the victim of kidnapping.

By observing these types of problems, I thought that, how one can seek the help easily of their loving ones, how one can feel secure while roaming at late night, how one can feel safe while going to school or tuition, Then I got the idea of using smartphone as a background service which can alert loving ones about one’s location while he or she is under the threat of his or herself.

**About System**

**SYSTEM DESIGN**
**User Module:**
- No Login module as the owner of the device is going to use this app only.
- Add Contact:  User adds contacts to send SMS and make call
- Delete Contact: User can also delete the contacts
- View Contacts: User can view the added contacts
- Manually user also can check the working of application by clicking emergencies button
---

**DATABASE DESIGN**
As of now the database used is SQLite database which only stores mobile number as a string and It is without the name of contact so only single column is there containing the list of contact numbers.##


**LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT** 
- The main limitation of current version of *Guardian Angel* is it needs to run in the background app but in future, I can add functionalities like working as a service in any android system infinitely.
- Other than that, as future enhancement one functionality of calling and sending location to police portal can also be done.

**CONCLUSION** 

This application will be emerged as an angel to seek the help easily when someone is under the threat.

When one is roaming at late night and specially around the desolate areas where no one is there to help and listen, one can use the gestures to call and send location if feels insecure about herself from the social evils and protect herself from being victim of one’s bad will.
