**ABSTRACT**

The “Guardian Angel” is specially made for the safety and security purpose of individual who may get stuck in danger and want help from their loving ones. There will be single user only in this app who wants to seek help under the threat. Firstly, one will fit the data into system that whom to ask for help then when she is under threat she will use predefined gesture to alert her contacts through SMS and call. SMS will contain her nearly accurate GPS location link which individual can track and reach there to help. Apart from SMS, Call will also be made by system automatically to alert individuals. This application is handy so one can easily use it even one is illiterate cause all user need is to do predefined gesture to alert her contacts. As the crimes are getting increase day by day, this application can emerge as a solution to seek help and prevent the act to be done. In future, one can also add some more functionalities to this app like calling Police and many more.

1. **PROJECT DETAILS**

**1.1.1 Project Profile**
**

**
`	`This project “*Guardian Angel*” is aimed to seek help from the near and dear ones under the situation of threat to one’s life. Mainly made for women travelling during late night or passing by some crucial areas where one cannot get help easily.

This application will be very helpful as it is so handy that even an illiterate person can use it and seek for help when she’s in danger. She just need to press power button 3 times and automatically her current location link will be sent through SMS to previously fitted mobile numbers and also call to the top most mobile number will be made automatically. Hence, her near and dear ones can track the location and reach out to her to help.

**1.1.2 Project Definition**

**	When one passes by some areas alone and find herself under the threat of social mob then she can alert her near ones that she is under the threat and they can help her out but sometimes it is not possible to call them or tell the location and all and may be if she is in emergency situation then it’s the worst solution to call manually. So this help is made in such a way that user needs to do some predefined gesture and call will be made automatically with SMS containing link of her actual current location.

1. **PURPOSE**

As the crimes are increasing day by day, to prevent it and protect one for being a victim of crime by seeking help and alerting her dear ones that she’s at this particular location and needs your help is the main purpose for developing Guardian Angel. By this application, one can safely roam at midnight as she knows that Guardian Angel is always with her to protect.
**


1. **SCOPE** 

At this stage, Guardian Angel provides facility to call and alert only contacts but in future facilities like calling police and sending them location of individuals can also be done as an extension of current version.

For example, right now the person who received the SMS containing location link, tracks it and reaches to the spot but in future, SMS to the police can also be made and can seek the help quickly.

1. **TECHNOLOGY AND LITERATURE REVIEW**

**1.4.1 Technology**
**
`	`XML: It is used for developing GUI of application.

`	`JAVA: Used for handling GUI events of controls.

`	`SQLite: SQLite database is used to store the contact nos.

`	`Android Studio: Functionalities of APIs is used through Android Studio.

**1.4.2 Literature Review**
**

**
`	`The newspapers and articles contain the heading of brutal rape cases or murder cases on each other day. One of them was blowing mind of everyone that a girl became victim of rape and though the spot area was near her house she could not found help though had having phone.

Many a times it’s been seen that the woman passing by some desolate area and became the quarry of one’s bad will as she could not seek help. It is not only about woman it is about children too. Like It has also been seen that children became the victim of kidnapping.

By observing these types of problems, I thought that, how one can seek the help easily of their loving ones, how one can feel secure while roaming at late night, how one can feel safe while going to school or tuition, Then I got the idea of using smartphone as a background service which can alert loving ones about one’s location while he or she is under the threat of his or herself.

**2.1 PROJECT PLANNING**

**2.1.1 Project Development Approach**

This project is developed using specific software development lifecycle. Software development approach is best suited for the project depends on the requirement and other factors. For this project, All the requirements were predefined like storing contacts and sending SMS containing location Link and also calling to topmost mobile number. Hence, I used the easiest SDLC model which is Waterfall Model.

![](Aspose.Words.b2d7762c-d6e8-4198-99b5-a79ab86bf8a7.011.png)

Figure 2.1.1 Waterfall model

**Requirements:** The main requirement to work this application is one smart phone containing sim card and balance to make call and send SMS containing location of individual.

**Design:** The goal of design phase is to turn requirements into actual implementation scenarios. In technical, during the design phase the software architecture is derived from the SRS document.

**Implementation:** During this phase, Code is generated with the help of design models. In nutshell, the coding part is done during this phase.

**Testing:** The application undergoes through some test cases to check its functionality and the error and correction part is made if any. This phase helps to identify the bug and resolve it.

**Deployment:** After the successful completion of testing phase, the application is deployed to use.

**Maintenance:**  The main and longest phase is maintenance of any application, which is a lifelong phase because user may face some vulnerabilities while using the application hence, it is necessary to maintain the application.

**2.2 FEASIBILITY STUDY**

Feasibility study is carried out when there is a complex problem or opportunity. It is considered as the primary investigation which emphasizes on “Look before You Loop” approach to any project. A Feasibility study is undertaken to determine the possibility of either improving the existing system or developing a completely new system.

We are going to developed the new system which is feasible as our application is very user friendly and easy to understand.

#### **2.2.1 Technical Feasibility**
In this type of study, the current technology in used in an organization is checked such as the existing software, hardware, and personnel staff to determine whether it will work for the proposed system or completely new ones is to be used. The proposed system is capable of adding, changing, enhancing functionality, features etc. The back-end and front-end technology has greater important for providing an accurate, error-free, frequencies of data to be used.

This project is technically feasible in terms of current technology. This project will provide latest platform like android technology.
#### **2.2.2 Economical Feasibility**
For proving that system developed is economical, the economic feasibility study takes place to check the cost of developing a system against the benefits that it provides. If the cost is less and benefits are more than we can define our system to be economically developed. 

In terms of economic feasibility this application is very reasonable in cost. So application is economically feasible.

#### **2.2.3 Operational Feasibility**
The operational feasibility is concerned with the operability of the system after it has been installed. That is, some programmer may not like changes in their routine method of work or has fear that they will lose their peer group. The following areas will have the operational feasibility in the proposed project.

- The organization has approved this system as their working system.
- The User of the system has accepted the proposed system as their new working system and realized the benefits of it.
- The system will work in a proper way after it has been installed and the installation process is easy to use.
- This application is that much handy that even illiterate person can use it and seek for the help when required.


**2.3 PROCESS IN NEW SYSTEM** 

As per the name *Guardian Angel*, this application can be emerged as an angel when one is under the threat and seeking help to protect herself.

The first of all, user will fit the data of contacts whom she wants to send location through the SMS and call too when she feels herself under the threat. 

Similarly, user can also have access to view the data she fitted into system and also have rights to do CRUD operations on that data. 

Now after this task, when user is under the threat, she will just press the power but 3 times and let the screen on and off 3 times then automatically the SMS containing the link of her location will be sent to the fitted contacts into database and call will also be made to the mobile number which she fitted first.

4. ` `**FEATURES OF NEW SYSTEM**
- Handy to use
- Can send location to more than one person
- Call automatically
- SMS automatically
- May use police siren to scare the criminals

**3.1 PROBLEM AND WEAKNESSES OF CURRENT SYSTEM:**

- The weakness of current system is that one has to manually enter the mobile number to seek the help and tell the guardians about the location by themselves. It would be very hectic task for one if she is under the threat and at times one may not be aware about her actual location.

**3.2 STUDY OF CURRENT SYSTEM** 

Though current system is having the option for emergency dialing but one can only call to emergency numbers like police or ambulance but not her guardians. And apart from that, Device must contain the higher version of android (recommended Android 12 or higher).

3. ` `**STUDY OF PROPOSED SYSTEM**

The proposed system is capable to run on any android device, no restriction on android versions user can able to run on any android versions. Apart from that, User is able to send location and make a call automatically hence she can aware guardians about her location and situation in short period of time without any kind of trouble.

- ## No Login module as the owner of the device is going to use this app only.
- ## Add Contact:  User adds contacts to send SMS and make call
- ## Delete Contact: User can also delete the contacts
- ## View Contacts: User can view the added contacts
- ## Manually user also can check the working of application by clicking emergencies button
##
**4.2 DATABASE DESIGN**

- ## As of now the database used is SQLite database which only stores mobile number as a string and It is without the name of contact so only single column is there containing the list of contact numbers.
##

|<h2>**Contact No.**</h2>|
| - |
|<h2>1234567891</h2>|
|<h2>9876543210</h2>|
|<h2>7894561230</h2>|
|7600371998|

**5.1 Environment** 

**5.2 Test Results and Analysis** 

**5.1 ENVIRONMENT**

**Android:**
**
`	`A Linux-based operating system designed primarily for touch screens mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. It supports a large number of applications on Smartphones. These applications are more comfortable and advanced for users.

**Android Studio:**

`	`Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development, based on IntelliJ IDEA. On top of IntelliJ's powerful code editor and developer tools, Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps.

**Java:**

`	`Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.

**SQLite Database:**

`	`SQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database.
**

**5.2 TEST RESULTS AND ANALYSIS** 

Software testing is a critical element of software quality Assurance and represents the ultimate review of specification, design and code generation. Testing is an internal part of any system or project. If a system is implemented without being tested it may lead to an erroneous working and dissatisfaction on part of the customer. It will also prove disastrous to the reputation of the organization or the person who developed the system and lead to loss in business.

Keeping all these things in view, I left no stone unturned in testing our systems. It was tested keeping in view the different possibilities on part of the user. As human beings are prone to commit errors under different working conditions, we had to keep our vigil on different possibilities that can occur on part of the user.

**Appendix B**

**LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT** 
- ## The main limitation of current version of *Guardian Angel* is it needs to run in the background app but in future, I can add functionalities like working as a service in any android system infinitely.
- ## Other than that, as future enhancement one functionality of calling and sending location to police portal can also be done.
##
**CONCLUSION** 

This application will be emerged as an angel to seek the help easily when someone is under the threat.

When one is roaming at late night and specially around the desolate areas where no one is there to help and listen, one can use the gestures to call and send location if feels insecure about herself from the social evils and protect herself from being victim of one’s bad will.
